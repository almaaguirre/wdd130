    <h2>Alma I. Aguirre Perez</h2>
    <p>
      Hello everyone, my name is Alma Aguirre. My goal here at BYU-I is to get a
      Bachelor's Degree in Applied Technology. I have always admired people who
      are savvy about technology and coding. This has always been a huge
      interest to me so here I am and I feel extremely blessed to have this
      opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Technology these days is essential and not only for those who are looking
      for a job in this area but I believe it is essential for everyone because
      technolgy is everywhere whether you're looking for it or not. For me it is
      a career choise but this new knowledge could help any one on a day to day
      basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was born in Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico but I have lived now in
      Northern California for over 30 years. I am a wife and a stay at home mom
      to a 14 year old daughter, a 12 year old son, and three 4 legged childen.

      I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Ladder Day Saints
      since 2004, the year I got married. A quote that I love and I can relate
      to often is by President Henry B. Eyring, "If you are on the right path,
      it will always be uphill".
    </p>
    <p>
      I am happy to be here, to meet so many of you from all over the world and
      to soon be working with you all.
